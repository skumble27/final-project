## Sector Forecast

**Sumukh Kumble**



**Introduction**

The objective of this project is to apply the principles and techniques of machine learning to train and create algorithms with the capacity to make accurate predictions based on historical data from various countries. In essence, this project seeks to implement this technology across a variety of sectors, namely, Healthcare, Agriculture, Economics and the Environment to determine what can be expected within a ten year window from 2020 onwards. By testing the algorithm across a variety of sectors and datasets, this project aims to validate if machine learning can be utilised to provide users with scope of what could possibly expected and with a degree of mathematical confidence.

**Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading**

For this project, data was extracted from several databases, which include the following:

1. [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) 
2. [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/)
3. [Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations](http://www.fao.org/home/en/)

The counties that were selected for this project are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Data pertaining to Healthcare, Agriculture, Economics and Environment, for each nation, were extracted from the above mentioned sources, cleaned using the Python Pandas Module and exported into file formats and uploaded into the SQL Databases.
